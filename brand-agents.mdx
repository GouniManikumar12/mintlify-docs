# Quickstart for Brand Agents

This guide shows how to connect your advertiser system to AIP and start bidding on verified AI intents.

---

## Step 1: Get Access

Create an advertiser account and obtain your **Agent API Key** from the [AdMesh Console](https://console.admesh.example/signup).

---

## Step 2: Set Up Your Endpoint

Brand Agents expose a bidding endpoint to receive intent data.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/bid", methods=["POST"])
def handle_bid():
    data = request.get_json()
    bid_value = calculate_bid(data["intent"])
    return jsonify({
        "price": bid_value,
        "creative": "Try our CRM for startups",
        "landing_url": "https://example.com/crm"
    })
```

---

## Step 3: Return Bid Payloads

Your endpoint should respond with structured JSON within 100–200 ms.

| Field | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `price` | Bid value per exposure or click |
| `creative` | Message or recommendation text |
| `landing_url` | Target link |
| `ttl` | Expiration time for bid validity |

---

## Step 4: Handle Verification Callbacks

AIP will notify you of verified **exposures**, **clicks**, or **conversions**.

Use these webhooks to track spend and ROI accurately.

```python
@app.route("/event", methods=["POST"])
def event_callback():
    event = request.get_json()
    log_event(event)
    return "ok"
```

---

## Step 5: Track Performance

Use your AdMesh dashboard to view:
- Bids served
- Verified events
- Wallet balance and CPA performance

✅ **Your advertiser agent is now live and participating in real-time auctions.**
