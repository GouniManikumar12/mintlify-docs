title: Brand Agents
description: How AI and autonomous advertiser agents participate in AIP auctions and respond to verified intent.
---
Brand Agents are AI agents or autonomous bidding systems that act on behalf of advertisers.  They evaluate incoming intent, decide whether to participate, and submit structured bids into AIP auctions.  

A Brand Agent can be rule based, ML driven, or fully autonomous. AIP does not prescribe how it is built, only how it must speak to the protocol.

---

The AIP bidding model uses a **time-bounded asynchronous auction window** rather than full broadcast fanout. When a platform sends a `PlatformRequest`, the AIP Operator derives a `context_request`, classifies it into one or more **category pools**, and only brand agents and advertiser networks that have explicitly subscribed to those pools receive the request. Distribution to bidders is handled through a cloud-agnostic **publish/subscribe transport**, starting with Google Pub/Sub in v1.0 and extendable to AWS SNS/SQS, Azure Event Grid, Kafka, or other message buses. After publishing the context, the AIP Server opens a short **auction window** (typically 30–70 ms) during which bidders may submit signed bids via `POST /aip/bid-response`. When the window closes, the server collects all bids received within the allowed timeframe, applies the AIP selection rules (CPA > CPC > CPX), and returns the `auction_result` to the platform. If no bids are received before the window expires, the server returns a valid `no_bid` response. This design enables scalable, category-aware bidding, minimizes latency, prevents unnecessary bidder fanout, and ensures that only relevant brand agents compete for each user intent.

For Brand Agents, this means:
- subscribe only to the pools (verticals, product categories, intents) you can serve
- maintain a low-latency listener on the publish/subscribe bus you’ve configured with the Operator
- respond via `POST /aip/bid-response` within the configured window (default 50 ms)

## 1. What Brand Agents Do

A Brand Agent:

- receives BidRequests from an AIP Operator  
- evaluates anonymized user intent  
- decides whether the advertiser wants to compete  
- returns a structured BidResponse  
- participates in real time auctions  
- receives verified CPX, CPC, and CPA callbacks  
- optimizes spend based on Operator ledger records  

Brand Agents can be operated by:

- SaaS or software companies  
- e commerce brands  
- mobile apps  
- marketplaces  
- agencies  
- affiliate networks  
- AI native advertiser bots  
- third party autonomous agents  

AIP imposes no limit on who can operate a Brand Agent.

## 2. Normative Responsibilities

The following are MUST, MUST NOT, and MAY requirements for all Brand Agents.

### Brand Agents MUST

- expose a stable HTTP endpoint or another transport supported by the Operator  
- respond to BidRequests within the Operator timeout  
- return one BidResponse per request  
- include at least one valid price field:  
  - `price_cpc` and or  
  - `price_cpa`  
- provide a valid `landing_url`  
- include required creative metadata  
- respect the AIP event ladder: CPA overrides CPC, CPC overrides CPX  
- verify serve tokens in event callbacks  
- maintain spend accuracy using Operator ledger entries  

### Brand Agents MUST NOT

- submit malformed or incomplete bid payloads  
- return bids without pricing  
- manipulate or forge serve tokens  
- generate artificial events or simulated traffic  
- submit multiple bids for a single BidRequest  

### Brand Agents MAY

- use any internal logic, including rules, heuristics, ML, LTV models, or autonomous agents  
- dynamically adjust pricing based on performance  
- decline to bid using `no_bid: true`  
- use contextual embeddings, RAG, or classifier models  
- implement their own budget and ROAS controls

## 3. BidRequest (What Brand Agents Receive)

Operators send a BidRequest when a platform submits user intent.

### Typical fields

| Field             | Description                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `intent.text`     | Anonymized user query or derived summary         |
| `session_id`      | Unique session identifier                        |
| `serve_token_hint`| Pre auction token reference                      |
| `categories`      | Optional taxonomies                              |
| `timestamp`       | Request creation time                            |
| `policy`          | Operator defined bidding rules or limits         |

Operators MAY include additional metadata.  
AIP allows extensibility.

## 4. BidResponse (What Brand Agents Return)

A BidResponse MUST conform to the AIP bid schema.

| Field        | Required | Description                                      |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `price_cpc`  | optional | Amount willing to pay for a click               |
| `price_cpa`  | optional | Amount willing to pay for a conversion          |
| `creative`   | required | Text or metadata used in the recommendation     |
| `landing_url`| required | Advertiser destination URL                      |
| `ttl`        | required | Validity window in milliseconds                 |
| `no_bid`     | optional | Indicates declining the request                 |

At least one of `price_cpc` or `price_cpa` MUST be included for a valid bid.

CPX does not require explicit bidding because it is always settled by the Operator when no higher event occurs.

---

## 5. Event Callbacks

Once a Brand Agent wins an auction, the Operator sends event notifications tied to the serve token.

### Event types

| Event | Meaning                                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| CPX   | Exposure happened, settled only if no CPC or CPA occurs    |
| CPC   | User clicked the recommendation                            |
| CPA   | User completed the target action                           |

Brand Agents MUST:

- verify the serve token  
- confirm the event order is valid per the event ladder  
- use callbacks for optimization and budget management  

Brand Agents MAY ignore CPX or CPC if they optimize only for CPA.

---

## 6. Wallets, Spend, and Settlement

AIP does not dictate a specific wallet architecture.

### Operator responsibilities

Operators MUST:

- maintain accurate spend ledgers  
- settle based on CPX, CPC, CPA event ladder  
- expose ledger records to Brand Agents  
- guarantee no double billing  

### Brand Agent responsibilities

Brand Agents MUST:

- track spend using Operator ledger entries  
- manage advertiser budgets  
- ensure funding is available for bidding  

Brand Agents MAY:

- pause bidding when caps are reached  
- adjust bids dynamically using ROAS or CAC targets  
- run ML pipelines that optimize by event type  

---

## 7. Implementation Guidance (Non Normative)

A Brand Agent can be implemented in any technology stack.

### Simple rules engine

```ts
if (intent.text.includes("CRM")) {
  bid_cpc = 2.0;
} else {
  no_bid = true;
}
````

### ML driven agent

* classify the query
* predict user value
* compute an optimal bid
* enforce margin and budget constraints

### Fully autonomous agent

* runs continuously
* learns from verified events
* adjusts pricing in real time
* optimizes cross operator ROAS

AIP cares only about interface correctness, not internal strategy.

## 8. Summary

Brand Agents are AI or autonomous advertiser agents that:

* receive intent
* evaluate relevance
* submit structured bids
* participate in real time auctions
* receive CPX, CPC, and CPA callbacks
* manage budgets and performance

AIP ensures:

* fair auction behavior
* transparent event settlement
* consistent interaction across Operators
* interoperability between advertiser agents

Brand Agents can be simple or deeply intelligent. The protocol defines the contract, not the strategy.
