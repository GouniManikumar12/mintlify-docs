title: Ad Networks
description: Deploy and operate an AIP-compliant ad network to manage auctions, verification, and settlements.
---

# Quickstart for Ad Networks

Ad Networks run the AIP infrastructure that connects AI Platforms and Advertiser Agents.  
They handle auctions, verify events, and manage payouts in a transparent, standardized way.

---

## Step 1: Clone and Deploy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/admesh/admesh-operator
cd admesh-operator
docker compose up -d
```

This launches a reference AIP node. You can self-host or extend it with your own bidding, compliance, or ledger modules.

---

## Step 2: Configure Wallet and Ledger

Edit your `.env` file to connect to your wallet and database.

```bash
AD_NETWORK_ID="admesh-us-1"
LEDGER_URL="postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/aip_ledger"
WALLET_SECRET="your_private_key"
```

---

## Step 3: Connect Components

Connect to the rest of the AIP ecosystem:

- **Advertiser Agents** via `/bid`
- **AI Platforms** via `/context`
- **Settlement Service** via `/payout`

```

## Step 4: Test the Auction Flow

Run a simple test to verify your setup:

```bash
curl -X POST https://adnetwork.example/api/test-auction   -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>"   -d '{"intent":"Best CRM for startups"}'
```

If successful, you will receive an `AuctionResult` payload containing bid and creative data.

---

## Step 5: Verify Events and Settlements

- Exposures, clicks, and conversions are logged with cryptographic signatures.  
- Monthly reconciliations ensure accurate payouts.  
- Use your ledger dashboard to review verified events and final settlements.

✅ **Your ad network is now live and compliant with AIP v0.1.**
