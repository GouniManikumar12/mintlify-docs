title: Versioning
description: Learn how AIP manages upgrades, backward compatibility, and schema evolution without breaking integrations.
---

Versioning ensures that AIP evolves safely while keeping every existing integration stable.

AIP is designed for **long-term stability**, allowing new capabilities to be introduced without breaking existing participants.

---

## 1. TL;DR

> AIP uses semantic versioning and explicit version headers to guarantee backward compatibility across the network.

---

## 2. Why it matters

Every AI platform, ad network, and brand agent depends on stable interfaces.  
Without consistent versioning, protocol updates could cause mismatched data or invalid events.

Versioning provides:
- Predictable upgrade paths  
- Stable APIs and schemas  
- Graceful deprecation for older implementations  

---

## 3. Version Format

AIP follows **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

| Level | Meaning | Example |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **MAJOR** | Incompatible protocol or schema changes | 1.0 → 2.0 |
| **MINOR** | Backward-compatible feature additions | 1.0 → 1.1 |
| **PATCH** | Backward-compatible fixes or optimizations | 1.1 → 1.1.1 |

Current AIP version: **0.1**

---

## 4. Version Headers

Every AIP request must include a version header.

```http
X-AIP-Version: 0.1
```

This header ensures all participants — Platforms, Ad Networks, and Brand Agents — know which version of the protocol is being used.

If a participant receives a higher version than supported, they can:
- Default to fallback behavior, or  
- Return a `VERSION_NOT_SUPPORTED` response.

---

## 5. Schema Versioning

Each JSON schema in the AIP specification includes a `"$version"` field.

Example:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://aip.dev/schemas/auction-result.json",
  "$version": "0.1.0",
  "auction_id": "auc_92b134",
  "winner": { "agent_id": "brand_quickbooks", "score": 0.87 }
}
```

This ensures that even if the API version remains the same, schemas can evolve independently with backward-compatible fields.

---

## 6. Deprecation Policy

AIP maintains a **six-month deprecation window** for any breaking change.

| Type | Notice Period | Example |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Minor Schema Change | 3 months | Adding optional field |
| Major Protocol Change | 6 months | Changing event verification flow |

Participants are notified through release notes and OpenAPI changelogs.

---

## 7. Compatibility Matrix

| Component | Compatible With | Grace Period |
|------------|------------------|--------------|
| Platform SDKs | Last 2 minor versions | 6 months |
| Ad Network APIs | All current MINOR versions | 9 months |
| Brand Agent Bidding APIs | Latest and previous version | 12 months |

Backward compatibility testing is part of AIP conformance checks.

---

## 8. Migration Guidelines

When upgrading:
1. Verify SDK compatibility in staging.  
2. Check new schema definitions under `/schemas/`.  
3. Use dual-version testing — old and new endpoints simultaneously.  
4. Once stable, update your `X-AIP-Version` header in production.

If breaking changes are introduced, AIP provides migration scripts or wrappers through the official SDKs.

---

## 9. Version Discovery

You can query supported versions via API:

```http
GET /versions
```

Response:

```json
{
  "current": "0.1.0",
  "supported": ["0.1.0", "0.0.9"],
  "deprecated_after": "2026-06-30"
}
```

---

## 10. Guarantees

- No breaking changes without notice.  
- All APIs are backward-compatible for at least one minor version.  
- Schema evolution follows additive-only rules within the same version.  
- SDKs are auto-updated to handle multiple AIP versions.

---

## Summary

> Versioning in AIP ensures progress without disruption — enabling innovation while maintaining trust and stability.
