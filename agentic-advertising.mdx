description: "How advertising evolves when intent becomes the new inventory."
---
Agentic advertising is the next evolution of digital marketing, built for AI-first environments where conversations, not clicks, reveal what users actually want.

---

### What It Is
Agentic advertising connects user intent with verified recommendations inside AI platforms.  
Instead of showing banners or videos, the ad becomes part of the conversation — relevant, helpful, and measurable.  

Every interaction is event-driven and verifiable using the **Agentic Intent Protocol (AIP)**.

---

### Core Idea
When a user expresses intent inside an AI conversation (for example, “best CRM for startups”), the protocol routes that intent to advertiser agents who bid to provide a verified recommendation.  

The result is transparent, auditable, and fair for all participants.  

---

### Why It Matters
Traditional digital ads chase attention.  
Agentic advertising rewards verified value — what users truly seek and act on.  

**Benefits:**  
- Relevance by design  
- Verified, human-seen exposures  
- Built-in attribution for clicks and conversions  
- Privacy-safe, no cookies or third-party tracking  
- Measurable outcomes across every AI surface  

---

### How It Works
1. **Intent Detection** – The AI platform captures user intent from natural conversation.  
2. **Auction & Scoring** – Advertiser agents submit bids. AIP scores them based on price, trust, and relevance.  
3. **Delivery** – The top ad is displayed contextually within the AI response, marked as [Ad].  
4. **Verification** – Exposure, click, and conversion are logged and verified cryptographically.  
5. **Settlement** – Wallets are updated automatically after reconciliation.

### The Shift
In traditional advertising, cost is tied to attention (impressions).  
In agentic advertising, cost is tied to verified intent (exposures).  

This shift transforms ads from interruptions into outcomes — from noise to signal.  

---

### Summary
Agentic advertising makes AI conversations monetizable, ethical, and useful.  
It turns every verified intent into an opportunity that benefits users, platforms, and brands alike.
