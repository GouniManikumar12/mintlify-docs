title: AIP Operators
description: Learn how to implement and operate an AIP-compatible ad network.
---
An **AIP operator** is any ad network that implements the Agentic Intent Protocol.  
Operators act as the bridge between:

- **AI Platforms** (who send anonymized intent)
- **Brand Agents** (who bid on that intent)
- **The AIP Ledger** (which verifies exposure, click, and conversion events)

AdMesh is the **reference operator**, but any company can build and run their own operator.

This page explains how operators work, what they must implement, and how others can integrate with them.

# What an Operator Does

Every operator must implement five core functions:

## 1. Receive ContextRequests from Platforms  
Operators accept anonymized user intent and create an **Auction Context**.

They must:

- validate payload  
- generate a serveToken  
- start or join an auction cycle  
- notify bidders (Brand Agents)

## 2. Run AIP Auctions  
Operators run a real-time auction using AIP rules:

- CPA outranks CPC  
- CPC outranks CPX  
- CPA and CPC bids must include budgets  
- Winning bid must be returned within operator-defined latency

## 3. Deliver AuctionResults  
Operators send the **winning recommendation** back to the platform.

This includes:

- product data  
- click URL (signed)  
- serveToken  
- billing model (CPX, CPC, CPA)

## 4. Verify Events (CPX, CPC, CPA)  
Operators must verify:

- **Exposure**: fired when UI SDK renders result  
- **Click**: via signed click redirect  
- **Conversion**: via advertiser callback or partner API  

All events must resolve to **one** billable unit per serveToken.

## 5. Maintain Wallets & Monthly Settlement  
Operators:

- track advertiser balances  
- track spend per serveToken  
- maintain signed ledger entries  
- generate monthly payouts to AI platforms  

AIP defines the rules. Operators implement them.

# Operator Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Required | Description |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| Context ingestion | Yes | Handle ContextRequests from platforms |
| Auction engine | Yes | Implement CPA > CPC > CPX logic |
| Event pipeline | Yes | Exposure, click, and conversion validation |
| Serve token system | Yes | Generate and sign immutable tokens |
| Wallet accounting | Yes | Maintain advertiser balances |
| Ledger & payouts | Yes | Monthly platform payments |
| UI SDK | Yes | Provide a frontend SDK for platforms |
| Weave SDK | Optional | Provide backend inline-weave SDK |
| Reporting dashboard | Optional | For advertisers and platforms |

---

# SDKs Provided by Operators (AdMesh Example)

An AIP operator may publish one or more SDKs.

AdMesh provides:

### **1. UI SDK** (required for platforms)

```bash
npm install admesh-ui-sdk
```

Used for:

- rendering results  
- exposure tracking  
- click tracking  
- fallback logic  
- session ID + message ID tracking  

### **2. Backend Weave SDK** (optional)

Node.js:

```bash
npm install @admesh/weave-node
```

Python:

```bash
pip install admesh-weave-python
```

Used for:

- fetching recommendations server-side  
- feeding the LLM for inline weaving  
- reducing follow-up fetches

# Operator Architecture (High-Level)

```
AI Platform (Frontend)
   → UI SDK
   → ContextRequest
   → AuctionResult render
   → Exposure/Click events

Brand Agents
   → Bid on auctions
   → Provide CPA/CPC/CPX values

Operator (You)
   → Context ingestion
   → Auction engine
   → Event verification
   → Wallet + ledger
   → Monthly payouts
```

# Implementing Your Own AIP Operator

To become an AIP operator, you must implement:

1. **ContextRequest API**  
2. **Auction API**  
3. **Bid API**  
4. **Event Verification API**  
5. **Wallets & Ledger logic**  
6. **UI SDK for platforms**  
7. **Click redirect system**  
8. **Platform authentication**  
9. **Advertiser authentication**  

The protocol defines the rules.  
Your operator defines the implementation.

# Why Become an Operator?

- Own the ad marketplace in your ecosystem  
- Monetize intent from AI platforms  
- Create your own advertiser marketplace  
- Maintain full transparency with AIP  
- Attract brand agents with performance-first bidding  
- Enable new revenue streams (CPX, CPC, CPA)

# AdMesh as an Operator (Reference Implementation)

AdMesh is the first operator built on AIP.

It provides:

- UI SDK (admesh-ui-sdk)  
- Weave backend SDKs  
- Wallet system  
- Real-time ledger  
- Advertiser dashboard  
- Platform dashboard  

Platforms can choose any operator, but AdMesh is the default reference.

# How to Integrate an Operator

Platforms must:

1. Sign up with the operator  
2. Get API key  
3. Install operator UI SDK  
4. Render results via UI SDK or Weave  
5. Post events (exposures, clicks)  
6. Receive monthly payouts

Brand Agents must:

1. Register with operator  
2. Create offers  
3. Bid programmatically  
4. Track spend  
5. Track conversions
