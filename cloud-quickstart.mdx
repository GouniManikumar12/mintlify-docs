# Quickstart for Cloud Providers

The AIP bidding model uses a **time-bounded asynchronous auction window** rather than full broadcast fanout. When a platform sends a `context_request`, the AIP Server classifies the request into one or more **category pools**. Only brand agents and advertiser networks that have explicitly subscribed to those pools receive the request. Distribution to bidders is handled through a cloud-agnostic **publish/subscribe transport**, starting with Google Pub/Sub in v1.0 and extendable to AWS SNS/SQS, Azure Event Grid, Kafka, or other message buses. After publishing the context, the AIP Server opens a short **auction window** (typically 30–70 ms) during which bidders may submit signed bids via `POST /aip/bid-response`. When the window closes, the server collects all bids received within the allowed timeframe, applies the AIP selection rules (CPA > CPC > CPX), and returns the `auction_result` to the platform. If no bids are received before the window expires, the server returns a valid `no_bid` response. This design enables scalable, category-aware bidding, minimizes latency, prevents unnecessary bidder fanout, and ensures that only relevant brand agents compete for each user intent.

## Google Cloud Pub/Sub (Reference)

1. **Create Topics** – For each category pool, create a topic named `aip-context-<pool>`.
2. **Create Subscriptions** – Provision pull subscriptions per Brand Agent, binding Cloud IAM service accounts with least-privilege roles (`roles/pubsub.subscriber`).
3. **Grant Publisher Role** – Assign the AIP Operator service account `roles/pubsub.publisher` on all topics.
4. **Configure AIP Server** – Set `auction.distribution.backend=pubsub`, add `project_id`, and ensure the topic prefix matches your naming convention.
5. **Deploy Bid Listener** – Brand Agents run lightweight subscribers (Python, Go, Node) that read messages, classify intents, and respond via HTTPS to `POST /aip/bid-response`.

## AWS SNS/SQS

- Mirror the topic layout with SNS topics per pool (e.g., `aip-context-retail`).
- Attach HTTPS or SQS subscriptions for each Brand Agent; enforce SigV4 or mutual TLS for delivery.
- Use a Lambda (or container) to bridge SNS messages into your bidding infrastructure, preserving the original `auction_id` and metadata.

## Azure Event Grid

- Create Event Grid topics scoped per pool or geography.
- Configure Event Subscriptions that push to Azure Functions, Logic Apps, or custom HTTPS endpoints operated by Brand Agents.
- Use Azure AD app registrations/service principals for authentication.

## Other Message Buses

Kafka, Pulsar, NATS, or RabbitMQ can be used as long as you:
- maintain ordering per pool
- guarantee delivery within the auction window
- support authenticated publish/subscribe semantics

## Operational Tips

- Keep the window between 30–70 ms; start with 50 ms and tune per region.
- Record `no_bid` outcomes so Platforms can differentiate empty pools from outages.
- Autoscale subscribers horizontally when pool volume surges.
- Monitor end-to-end latency (publish → subscriber receive → `bid-response`) and drop late bids proactively.
