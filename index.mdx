title: Agentic Intent Protocol (AIP)
description: The open standard for monetizing AI intent, transparent, auditable, and interoperable.
---
### What is AIP?

AIP is an open, operator-agnostic protocol that turns user intent inside AI conversations into a trusted signal that brand-operated bidding agents can respond to. 

It defines how AI platforms send intent, how brand agents place bids, and how every exposure, click, or action is verified and billed correctly—without requiring a single controlling platform, network, or vendor.

AIP is designed to complement existing advertising standards while addressing gaps specific to AI-native interfaces and conversational systems. AIP is UCP-aligned, using the Universal Context Protocol (UCP) format for PlatformRequest to ensure interoperability with UCP-compliant systems.

### Why AIP exists

AI conversations show what people really want. This is their intent.  
Until now there has been no clear or fair way to:

- connect that intent to advertisers  
- let brands respond in a trusted way  
- measure what actually happened

Every platform handles intent differently, with no shared method.  
This makes intent hard to use, hard to verify, and hard to settle.

**AIP fixes this by creating one simple open way to handle intent:**

- AI platforms capture and send intent safely  
- Brand-operated bidding agents can choose to respond with bids  
- Every exposure, click, or action is verified  
- All payments are settled in a transparent wallet and ledger system

In simple terms:  
**AIP makes intent from AI conversations usable, fair, and trustworthy for AI platforms, advertisers, and users.**


### What AIP standardizes

| Layer | What it does | Why it matters |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Context Ingestion** | Collects anonymized intent from AI platforms | Enables precise and privacy safe matching |
| **Real-Time Auction** | Allows brand agents to bid on verified intent | Creates fair pricing based on real demand |
| **Event Verification** | Tracks CPX, CPC, and CPA with signed events | Prevents fraud and double charging |
| **Wallet Settlement** | Automates payouts and audits | Makes billing clear, predictable, and trusted |

### Built-in guarantees

- One verified charge per event  
- Priority order: CPA > CPC > CPX  
- CPX represents a verified opportunity-to-see inside an AI interface, not a traditional impression  
- Signed and auditable ledger  
- Works with any ad network or operator

### Who benefits

**AI Platforms**  
Gain a sustainable monetization model without hurting user experience.

**Advertisers**  
Pay only for verified intent with clear and trusted results.

**Users**  
See helpful and relevant recommendations instead of noise.

### Example: How it works

1. User asks: **"Best accounting software for freelancers?"**  
2. AI platform sends anonymized intent context  
3. Ad network(AIP Operator) runs a real-time auction  
4. Brand agents submit bids  
5. Winning bid is returned to the AI platform  
6. AI shows the recommendation  
7. User clicks or converts  
8. AIP verifies the event and settles the payout

### TL;DR

**AIP turns AI intent into a trusted and monetizable signal for platforms, agents, and advertisers.**
