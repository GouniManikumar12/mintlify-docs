# Welcome to AMXP

**AMXP (AdMesh Exchange Protocol)** is an open standard for monetizing user intent in AI-powered and agentic environments. It enables platforms, advertisers, and ad networks to operate compliant, interoperable marketplaces for AI-native advertising.

## What is AMXP?

AMXP defines how supply-side platforms, demand-side bidders, and auditing agents communicate intent, enforce policy, and settle value in real-time.
