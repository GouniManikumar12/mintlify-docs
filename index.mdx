## The new standard for monetizing AI intent

AIP is an **open protocol** that lets AI platforms and advertisers **transact on verified user intent**, not just impressions or clicks.  
It defines how AI systems, agents, and advertisers exchange context, bids, and verified outcomes in a transparent way.

---

## Why AIP exists

AI conversations reveal what users actually want, their **intent**.  
Until now, there has been no common way to connect that intent with advertisers or measure it fairly.

AIP solves this by standardizing how intent is:

- Captured from AI platforms  
- Matched with brand agents  
- Verified when a user engages or converts  
- Settled transparently through wallets and ledgers  

---

## What AIP standardizes

| Layer | What it does | Why it matters |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| **Context Ingestion** | Collects anonymized intent from AI platforms | Enables precise, privacy-safe matching |
| **Real-Time Auction** | Lets brand agents bid on verified intent | Creates market-based pricing for intent |
| **Event Verification** | Tracks CPX, CPC, and CPA outcomes with signatures | Prevents fraud and double charging |
| **Wallet Settlement** | Automates monthly payouts and auditing | Makes billing deterministic and trusted |

---

## Built-in guarantees

- One verified charge per event  
- Priority order: **CPA → CPC → CPX**  
- Signed and auditable ledger  
- Interoperable with any ad network

  participant U as User
  participant P as AI Platform
  participant AIP as AIP Network
  participant AA as Brand Agents
  participant W as Wallet Ledger

  U->>P: "Best accounting software for freelancers?"
  P->>AIP: Send anonymized intent context
  AIP->>AA: Run real-time auction
  AA->>AIP: Submit bids
  AIP->>P: Return top bid (QuickBooks)
  P->>U: Display ad or recommendation
  U->>AIP: Click or conversion event
  AIP->>W: Verify and settle payout
```
