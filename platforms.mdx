# Platform

A Platform is a user-facing application or interface where natural language intent is expressed. Platforms submit this intent to an AIP Operator and display the operator’s ranked recommendations back to the user. 

Within AIP, platforms function as the protocol’s publishers — they surface intent and deliver outcomes, while all auction, scoring, and billing processes are handled entirely by the Operator.

## Definition

A **Platform** is an application, interface, or agentic environment that:

1. **Receives user intent**  
   Platforms capture user queries, commands, or questions expressed in natural language.

2. **Emits a `PlatformRequest` to an AIP Operator**  
   The operator derives the downstream `ContextRequest`, then handles auctions, ranking, and selection internally.

3. **Renders recommendations**  
   Platforms display operator-returned recommendations using protocol-standard formats  
   (Citation, Product, or Weave).

4. **Tracks and forwards signed events**  
   Platforms report exposure and click events using the operator SDK, ensuring  
   serve-token integrity and attribution.

5. **Receives payouts for verified events**  
   Operators credit platforms for valid exposures, clicks, or conversions based on  
   AIP settlement rules.

## Characteristics

Platforms MUST:

- Run an operator-provided UI SDK  
- Maintain a session identifier for each user conversation  
- Display transparency labels  
- Ensure accurate event propagation

Platforms MAY:

- Use optional backend SDKs for inline (Weave) embedding  
- Add platform-specific UI or UX layers around recommendations  
- Surface recommendations inside various modalities (text, voice, multimodal)

## Asynchronous Auction Interaction

The AIP bidding model uses a **time-bounded asynchronous auction window** rather than full broadcast fanout. When a platform sends a `PlatformRequest`, the AIP Operator derives a `context_request`, classifies the request into one or more **category pools**, and only brand agents and advertiser networks that have explicitly subscribed to those pools receive it. Distribution to bidders is handled through a cloud-agnostic **publish/subscribe transport**, starting with Google Pub/Sub in v1.0 and extendable to AWS SNS/SQS, Azure Event Grid, Kafka, or other message buses. After publishing the context, the AIP Server opens a short **auction window** (typically 30–70 ms) during which bidders may submit signed bids via `POST /aip/bid-response`. When the window closes, the server collects all bids received within the allowed timeframe, applies the AIP selection rules (CPA > CPC > CPX), and returns the `auction_result` to the platform. If no bids are received before the window expires, the server returns a valid `no_bid` response. This design enables scalable, category-aware bidding, minimizes latency, prevents unnecessary bidder fanout, and ensures that only relevant brand agents compete for each user intent.

Platform implication: always handle `no_bid` responses gracefully (render a fallback or continue the user workflow) while still recording the exposure attempt in your telemetry.


## Examples of Platforms

A Platform can be:

- AI assistants  
- Chat-based search engines  
- Browsers with conversational UI  
- Voice assistants  
- Productivity apps with embedded AI  
- Messaging apps with AI features  
- Browser extensions or agent runtimes  
- Autonomous multi-agent surfaces  
- Any interface capable of receiving natural language input and showing results

If a system can “hear” a user request and show a returned recommendation, it can be a Platform in AIP.

## Role Within the Protocol

Platforms are the entry point for user intent.  
Operators manage the economic layer.  
Brand Agents participate in auctions.

**Intent → Platform → Operator → Recommendations → Events → Payouts**

The Platform is the surface where intent is captured and value is created.
