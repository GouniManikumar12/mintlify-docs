# Platforms

A Platform is a user-facing application or interface where natural language intent is expressed. Platforms submit this intent to an AIP Operator and display the operator's ranked recommendations back to the user.

Within AIP, platforms function as the protocol's publishers — they surface intent and deliver outcomes, while all auction, scoring, and billing processes are handled entirely by the Operator.

## What is a Platform?

A **Platform** is an application, interface, or agentic environment that:

1. **Receives user intent**  
   Platforms capture user queries, commands, or questions expressed in natural language.

2. **Emits a `PlatformRequest` (UCP-aligned format) to an AIP Operator**  
   The operator derives the downstream `ContextRequest`, then handles auctions, ranking, and selection internally.

3. **Renders recommendations**  
   Platforms display operator-returned recommendations using protocol-standard formats (Citation, Product, or Weave).

4. **Tracks and forwards signed events**  
   Platforms report exposure and click events using the operator SDK, ensuring serve-token integrity and attribution.

5. **Receives payouts for verified events**  
   Operators credit platforms for valid exposures, clicks, or conversions based on AIP settlement rules.

## Examples of Platforms

Examples of Platforms include:

- AI assistants and copilots
- Chat-based search interfaces
- Browsers with conversational or agentic UI
- Voice assistants
- Productivity applications with embedded AI
- Messaging applications with AI features
- Browser extensions or agent runtimes
- Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) environments with conversational or agentic interfaces
- Autonomous multi-agent environments

If a system can "hear" a user request and show a returned recommendation, it can be a Platform in AIP.

## Platform Responsibilities

### Platforms MUST

- Run an operator-provided UI SDK
- Maintain a session identifier for each user conversation
- Display transparency labels
- Ensure accurate event propagation
- Provide `latency_budget_ms` in PlatformRequest to specify the auction timing window

### Platforms MAY

- Use optional backend SDKs for inline (Weave) embedding
- Add platform-specific UI or UX layers around recommendations
- Surface recommendations inside various modalities (text, voice, multimodal)

## Asynchronous Auction Interaction

The AIP bidding model uses a **time-bounded asynchronous auction window** rather than full broadcast fanout.

### How it works

1. Platform sends a `PlatformRequest` with `latency_budget_ms` to the Operator
2. Operator derives a `ContextRequest`, classifies it into one or more **category pools**
3. Only brand agents subscribed to those pools receive the request via publish/subscribe transport
4. Operator computes the available bid window by subtracting operator overhead from the platform's `latency_budget_ms`
5. Brand agents submit signed bids via `POST /aip/bid-response` within the computed window
6. Operator collects bids, applies AIP selection rules (CPA > CPC > CPX), and returns the `auction_result`
7. If no bids are received before the window expires, Operator returns a valid `no_bid` response

### Distribution transport

Distribution to bidders is handled through a cloud-agnostic **publish/subscribe transport**, starting with Google Pub/Sub in v1.0 and extendable to AWS SNS/SQS, Azure Event Grid, Kafka, or other message buses.

### Platform implications

- Always handle `no_bid` responses gracefully (render a fallback or continue the user workflow)
- Record exposure attempts in your telemetry even when no bid is returned
- Specify `latency_budget_ms` in PlatformRequest to control auction timing

This design enables scalable, category-aware bidding, minimizes latency, prevents unnecessary bidder fanout, and ensures that only relevant brand agents compete for each user intent.

## Role Within the Protocol

Platforms are the entry point for user intent.  
Operators manage the economic layer.  
Brand Agents participate in auctions.

**Intent → Platform → Operator → Recommendations → Events → Payouts**

The Platform is the surface where intent is captured and value is created.
