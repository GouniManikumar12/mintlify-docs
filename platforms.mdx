description: Learn how to integrate AIP into your AI platform and monetize verified user intent.
---

This guide helps AI platforms integrate AIP and start monetizing verified user intent in minutes.

---

## Step 1: Get Credentials

Create an account in the [AdMesh Console](https://console.admesh.example/signup) and generate your **Platform API Key**.  
You will use this key to authenticate with AIP services.

---

## Step 2: Install SDK

Choose one of the official SDKs based on your stack:

```bash
# Node.js
npm install admesh-weave-node

# Python
pip install admesh-weave-python
```

---

## Step 3: Send a ContextRequest

Detect when a user query or conversation shows monetizable intent, then send a `ContextRequest`.

```js
import { sendContextRequest } from "admesh-weave-node";

const response = await sendContextRequest({
  intent: "Best CRM for startups",
  userRegion: "US",
  sessionId: "abc123"
});
```

---

## Step 4: Render the AuctionResult

Render the response from AIP with a clear disclosure label `[Ad]`.

```jsx
<div>
  <p>{response.recommendation}</p>
  <span>[Ad]</span>
</div>
```

---

## Step 5: Post Events

Track verified events to ensure accurate billing.

- **Exposure** → When the ad is rendered  
- **Click** → When the user interacts  
- **Conversion** → When the user signs up or purchases

```js
await postEvent({ type: "exposure", serveToken });
await postEvent({ type: "click", serveToken });
await postEvent({ type: "conversion", serveToken });
```

---

## Step 6: Monitor Payouts

- **Real-time ledger:** View exposures, clicks, and conversions as they occur.  
- **Monthly settlement:** Platform requests payout after reconciliation.  

✅ **Integration complete.** Your platform now earns revenue from verified AI intent.
