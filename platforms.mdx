# Platform

A Platform is a user-facing application or interface where natural language intent is expressed. Platforms submit this intent to an AIP Operator and display the operator’s ranked recommendations back to the user. 

Within AIP, platforms function as the protocol’s publishers — they surface intent and deliver outcomes, while all auction, scoring, and billing processes are handled entirely by the Operator.

## Definition

A **Platform** is an application, interface, or agentic environment that:

1. **Receives user intent**  
   Platforms capture user queries, commands, or questions expressed in natural language.

2. **Emits a `ContextRequest` to an AIP Operator**  
   The operator handles auctions, ranking, and selection internally.

3. **Renders recommendations**  
   Platforms display operator-returned recommendations using protocol-standard formats  
   (Citation, Product, or Weave).

4. **Tracks and forwards signed events**  
   Platforms report exposure and click events using the operator SDK, ensuring  
   serve-token integrity and attribution.

5. **Receives payouts for verified events**  
   Operators credit platforms for valid exposures, clicks, or conversions based on  
   AIP settlement rules.

## Characteristics

Platforms MUST:

- Run an operator-provided UI SDK  
- Maintain a session identifier for each user conversation  
- Display transparency labels  
- Ensure accurate event propagation

Platforms MAY:

- Use optional backend SDKs for inline (Weave) embedding  
- Add platform-specific UI or UX layers around recommendations  
- Surface recommendations inside various modalities (text, voice, multimodal)


## Examples of Platforms

A Platform can be:

- AI assistants  
- Chat-based search engines  
- Browsers with conversational UI  
- Voice assistants  
- Productivity apps with embedded AI  
- Messaging apps with AI features  
- Browser extensions or agent runtimes  
- Autonomous multi-agent surfaces  
- Any interface capable of receiving natural language input and showing results

If a system can “hear” a user request and show a returned recommendation, it can be a Platform in AIP.

## Role Within the Protocol

Platforms are the entry point for user intent.  
Operators manage the economic layer.  
Brand Agents participate in auctions.

**Intent → Platform → Operator → Recommendations → Events → Payouts**

The Platform is the surface where intent is captured and value is created.
