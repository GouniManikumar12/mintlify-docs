title: Conformance
description: Verify that your implementation of AIP is compliant, interoperable, and production-ready.
---

Conformance defines how any participant — Platform, Ad Network, or Brand Agent — proves they follow the Agentic Intent Protocol correctly.

It ensures interoperability across the ecosystem and prevents inconsistent behavior across implementations.

---

## 1. TL;DR

> Conformance verifies that every message, signature, and event in your system behaves exactly as the AIP specification defines.

---

## 2. Why it matters

AIP is a multi-party protocol. If even one participant deviates from the standard — mismatched schema, unsynced version, or invalid ledger entry — the whole chain can break.

Conformance guarantees that:  
- All participants follow the same data and security standards  
- Every verified event is trusted across networks  
- Integrations remain stable through version upgrades  

---

## 3. Conformance Levels

| Level | Participant | Requirements |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| **Level 1** | Platform | Can send valid ContextRequests and handle AuctionResults |
| **Level 2** | Ad Network | Can manage auctions, verify events, and maintain a compliant ledger |
| **Level 3** | Brand Agent | Can bid, sign, and verify events according to schema and timing rules |

Every participant must pass at least one level to claim compliance.

---

## 4. Test Suite

The AIP Test Suite validates protocol behavior through reproducible test cases.

You can run it locally or via CI/CD integration:

```bash
npx @admesh/aip-test-suite run --role=adnetwork --version=0.1
```

This runs hundreds of schema, timing, and verification checks to ensure full compliance.

### Categories

| Category | Checks |
|-----------|--------|
| **Schema** | JSON validation, required fields |
| **Security** | Signature, nonce, and timestamp tests |
| **Events** | Exposure, click, and conversion state validation |
| **Ledger** | Settlement logic and reconciliation integrity |
| **Performance** | Response latency and throughput compliance |

---

## 5. Example Report

```json
{
  "role": "adnetwork",
  "version_tested": "0.1",
  "schema_valid": true,
  "security_valid": true,
  "ledger_consistent": true,
  "avg_latency_ms": 180,
  "result": "PASS"
}
```

Reports can be exported as JSON or uploaded to the AdMesh console for automated verification.

## 6. Required vs Optional Features

| Feature | Required | Optional |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Event verification | ✅ |  |
| Signed payloads | ✅ |  |
| Real-time metrics endpoint | ✅ |  |
| Multi-wallet payout handling |  | ✅ |
| Cross-network reconciliation |  | ✅ |

Optional features improve network efficiency but are not mandatory for certification.

---

## 7. Certification Flow

1. Register your participant ID in the AdMesh Console.  
2. Run the AIP Test Suite locally or via API.  
3. Upload signed results for review.  
4. Receive a conformance badge and public listing under verified participants.

Example badge:

```
✅ AIP Conformant (Ad Network v0.1)
```

---

## 8. Continuous Conformance

Each release of the AIP SDK automatically runs conformance regression tests to ensure backward compatibility.

Participants are notified when new test cases or version requirements are published.

---

## 9. Failure and Debugging

If your implementation fails a test:

- Review the failing schema or signature logs in the output.  
- Use `--verbose` to trace the failing request.  
- Check your `X-AIP-Version` header and schema references.  
- Retest after applying fixes.

---

## 10. Guarantees

- Only verified participants can transact on production AIP networks.  
- Conformance results are cryptographically signed and timestamped.  
- Certification ensures cross-platform interoperability and fairness.  

---

## Summary

> Conformance turns AIP from a specification into a living standard — measurable, auditable, and enforceable.
