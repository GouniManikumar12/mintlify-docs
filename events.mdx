title: Events
description: Learn how AIP verifies exposures, clicks, and conversions to enable fair, auditable billing.
---

Every measurable action in AIP is recorded as an **Event**.  
Events are how the protocol verifies that value was created — from a user seeing an ad to completing a conversion.

---

## 1. TL;DR

> Events track and verify each stage of user engagement: exposure, click, and conversion.

---

## 2. Why it matters

Traditional ad systems rely on cookies or opaque tracking pixels.  
AIP replaces those with **signed, timestamped events** that can be independently verified by all participants.

This means:
- No duplicate billing  
- No fake clicks or conversions  
- Transparent proof of every monetized action  

---

## 3. The Event Ladder

AIP defines three progressive event types — each building on the last.  
Only **one unit** settles per `serve_token`.

| Event Type | Abbreviation | Trigger | Billing Unit | Verified By |
|-------------|--------------|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Exposure** | CPX | User sees an ad or recommendation | Cost per Exposure | Platform |
| **Click** | CPC | User clicks or engages | Cost per Click | Platform + Ad Network |
| **Conversion** | CPA | User completes a purchase or signup | Cost per Action | Brand Agent + Ad Network |

Once a higher event (like CPA) is verified, lower-tier events (CPX or CPC) are not billed again.

## 4. Event lifecycle

```mermaid

    [*] --> Exposure
    Exposure --> Click: User interacts
    Click --> Conversion: User completes goal
    Conversion --> [*]
```

Each transition is verified and timestamped.  
If no further event occurs, the lifecycle ends at the last verified state.

---

## 5. EventPacket schema

All events follow a shared structure that makes them cryptographically verifiable.

```json
{
  "serve_token": "srv_20381f",
  "event_type": "click",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-12T01:42:00Z",
  "signature": "a3f0ab92...",
  "metadata": {
    "platform_id": "plat_ai_example",
    "agent_id": "brand_quickbooks",
    "session_id": "sess_441",
    "user_region": "US"
  }
}
```

The `serve_token` links each event back to the original auction and winning bid.

---

## 6. Verification process

| Stage | Who Verifies | What’s Checked |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Exposure** | Platform | Display logs and visibility events |
| **Click** | Platform + Ad Network | User interaction + timestamp |
| **Conversion** | Brand Agent + Ad Network | Server-side callback or API confirmation |

Every event is digitally signed and validated against the original `serve_token`.  
Discrepancies automatically trigger reconciliation or rejection.

---

## 7. Example flow

1. Platform renders a sponsored recommendation → **CPX logged**  
2. User clicks the recommendation → **CPC verified**  
3. User signs up on advertiser site → **CPA confirmed**  
4. Lower events (CPX, CPC) are marked as verified but not billed  

---

## 8. Payout implications

- Platforms are paid for verified **CPX** and **CPC** events.  
- Advertisers pay only for **CPC** or **CPA** events that pass verification.  
- Ad Networks mediate settlement and ledger reconciliation at the end of each cycle.

---

## 9. Guarantees

- Each event is uniquely linked to a serve token.  
- Events cannot be duplicated or retroactively modified.  
- Signatures are auditable by any party in the chain.  
- Billing and payout data are mathematically verifiable.

---

## Summary

> Events are the backbone of AIP — they turn user actions into verified, auditable, and monetizable outcomes.
