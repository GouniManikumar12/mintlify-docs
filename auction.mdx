# Auction and Scoring
AIP runs a short timed auction. When a platform sends a `PlatformRequest`, the operator tags it into category pools, derives a `ContextRequest`, and sends it only to Brand Agents subscribed to those pools. Delivery happens through a pub/sub system.

Agents have about 30–70 ms to send a signed bid. When the window closes, the Operator scores all bids (CPA first, then CPC, then CPX) and returns the winner. If no one responds in time, it returns no_bid.

The model avoids blasting every bidder, keeps latency low, and ensures only relevant agents compete.

## 1. TL;DR

AIP evaluates all eligible bids and returns the offer with the highest protocol-defined score.

## 2. Why It Matters

AIP enables AI systems to monetize intent responsibly.  
Auctions prioritize relevance, quality, and economic value, creating recommendations that feel useful, aligned, and trustworthy.

This ensures:

- AI experiences remain user-centric  
- Brands compete on merit and integrity  
- Platforms gain a predictable monetization layer  

## 3. How an Auction Works

Every user intent triggers a micro-auction. The sequence is:

### **1. Intent Enters the System**
An AI platform submits a `PlatformRequest` describing the user’s query or action.

### **2. Bid Requests Are Issued**
The Operator classifies the request into category pools, derives a `ContextRequest`, and uses publish/subscribe transport to deliver it only to Brand Agents subscribed to those pools.

### **3. Bids Are Returned**
During the 30–70 ms auction window, each Brand Agent sends a signed `POST /aip/bid-response` payload with:
- an offer  
- a bid price  
- necessary metadata  

### **4. Scoring Pipeline Evaluates Bids**
The Operator runs its scoring model and produces a ranking.

### **5. A Single Winner Is Returned**
The Operator sends the `AuctionResult` (or `no_bid` when no responses arrive in time) and `serve_token` back to the Platform.

## 4. Scoring Model

AIP scoring evaluates each bid using three core signals:

### **Value**
Economic strength of the bid relative to the current intent.

### **Relevance**
Alignment between the offer and the user’s query, conversation, or task context.

### **Quality**
Trust, integrity, and historical performance signals from the Brand Agent’s verified events.

The Operator applies these pillars consistently for all bids, producing a deterministic score for each candidate.  
The highest-scoring offer becomes the result of the auction.

## 5. AuctionResult

```json
{
  "auction_id": "auc_981",
  "serve_token": "stk_abcxyz123",
  "winner": {
    "agent_id": "ag_123",
    "clearing_price_cpx": "0.042",
    "preferred_unit": "CPA"
  },
  "render": {
    "label": "[Ad]",
    "title": "Pipedrive CRM",
    "body": "Built for founders.",
    "cta": "Try for free",
    "url": "https://admesh.click/stk_abcxyz123"
  },
  "ttl_ms": 60000
}
```

## 6. Transparency and Verification

Every exchange in the auction cycle is logged as verifiable artifacts:

- signed `ContextRequest`  
- signed `BidResponse`  
- signed `AuctionResult`  
- timestamps and nonces  
- protocol version identifiers  

## 7. Example Flow

User asks: **“Best AI note-taking tools.”**

1. A `ContextRequest` is issued.  
2. The Operator distributes it to eligible Brand Agents.  
3. Agents return bids.  
4. The scoring pipeline ranks them.  
5. The Platform receives a single recommendation and a `serve_token`.  
6. Exposure and click events connect cleanly to the same attribution chain.

## 8. Guarantees

AIP ensures:

- consistent evaluation across all Brand Agents  
- deterministic outcomes for identical inputs  
- complete verifiability via signed artifacts  
- unified attribution through the `serve_token`  
- scalable real-time performance  

## Summary

AIP auctions transform user intent into ranked recommendations through a structured, deterministic evaluation system. The protocol harmonizes how Platforms monetize intent, how Brand Agents compete, and how Operators deliver transparent, reproducible outcomes.
