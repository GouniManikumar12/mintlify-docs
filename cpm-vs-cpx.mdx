title: "CPM vs CPX"
description: "Understanding the economic shift from impressions to verified exposures."
---
Advertising economics are evolving from attention-based pricing (CPM) to intent-based pricing (CPX).

---

### The Legacy Model: CPM
CPM (Cost per Mille) charges advertisers per 1,000 impressions — regardless of quality, visibility, or user intent.  
It rewards volume, not relevance.

**Problems:**  
- Fake impressions and bot traffic  
- No link between spend and outcomes  
- Weak attribution and delayed reporting  

---

### The Intent Model: CPX
CPX (Cost per Exposure) measures verified, human-seen exposures tied to an explicit intent signal inside an agentic environment.  

Each CPX event is:  
- Signed by verifiers (platform + network)  
- Linked to a serve_token  
- Auditable end-to-end  

Advertisers pay only for real, verified interactions — not assumptions.

---

### Why Create a New Metric?
Many advertisers ask: *why change?* CPM has worked for decades and is easy to understand.  
But AI-driven discovery breaks the assumptions that made CPM valid.  

In a conversational context:  
- There are no “pages” or “impressions” to count.  
- What matters is whether an AI system truly *exposed* a verified recommendation to a user with intent.  
- CPX gives advertisers confidence that every dollar tracks to a verified, human exposure — not a background impression.  

So CPX doesn’t replace CPM out of novelty — it replaces it out of necessity.

### Key Differences
| Dimension | CPM (Legacy) | CPX (Agentic) |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Unit | 1,000 impressions | 1 verified exposure |
| Verification | Pixel / cookie logs | Signed event packets |
| Context | Page view | AI conversation intent |
| Fraud Resistance | Low | High |
| ROI Tracking | Indirect | Deterministic |
| User Experience | Intrusive | Contextual |
| Value Alignment | Quantity | Quality |

---

### Why CPX Wins
- Eliminates waste and fraud  
- Ensures fairness — every exposure is verified  
- Strengthens trust between brands, agents, and platforms  
- Creates a shared metric for monetizing AI intent  

---

### Transition Path
Most networks can map CPM → CPX using a simple equivalence:

**$10 CPM ≈ $0.01 CPX per verified exposure**  
(1,000 verified CPX events ≈ $10 spend)

This allows advertisers to migrate gradually without changing total budgets.

---

### Summary
CPX is not just a new metric — it’s a correction.  
It aligns cost with verified value, making *intent* the new unit of trade in the agentic advertising economy.
