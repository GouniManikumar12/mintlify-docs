title: "CPM vs CPX"
description: "Understanding the economic shift from impressions to verified exposures."
---
Advertising economics are evolving from attention-based pricing (CPM) to intent-based pricing (CPX).

---

### The Legacy Model: CPM
CPM (Cost per Mille) charges advertisers per 1,000 impressions.

`CPM = $3` means `1 impression = $0.003`
(The math is correct — the price is prorated per impression.)

The problem isn't the **math** — it's the **counting**: what qualifies as an "impression."

---

### Correct Understanding of CPM

**CPM = Cost per 1,000 impressions.**

So:

If CPM = `$3`
Then `1 impression = $0.003`
(3 dollars / 1000)

This part is **correct** and widely understood.

> **You pay for every impression, even if the impression was low-quality, barely visible, ignored, or served to someone with no intent.**

So the problem isn't the **math** — the math is fine.
The problem is the **counting** — what qualifies as an "impression."

---

### REAL PROBLEM #1: CPM counts impressions that aren't worth paying for

In CPM systems:

* an impression is logged when an ad loads
* even if the user scrolls past instantly
* even if the ad is below the fold
* even if the user isn't actually paying attention
* even if the user's intent is zero
* even if the context is irrelevant

So advertisers DO pay $0.003 per impression —
but most of those impressions **should not have been counted**.

This is the real flaw.

---

### REAL PROBLEM #2: CPM doesn't measure *intent*

CPM measures:

> "Did we show the ad?"

But not:

* Was the user interested?
* Did they ask for this?
* Did it match their need?
* Was it in the right moment?
* Did the AI conversation imply any intent?

So CPM → counts everything
CPX → counts only **intent exposures**

That's the difference.

---

### REAL PROBLEM #3: CPM inflates inventory artificially

Platforms have incentive to show:

* more impressions
* more ad slots
* more page loads
* more "scroll depth" tracking
* more feed units

All because CPM rewards **volume**, not **quality**.

You pay $0.003 per impression — yes.
But 60–80% of those impressions are **low-value**.

That's why CPA and CPC outperform CPM in many verticals.

---

### REAL PROBLEM #4: CPM is meaningless in AI environments

AI chats and agents don't have:

* pages
* feeds
* banners
* scroll depth
* viewable areas

So you can't use CPM because there's no "impression surface."

CPX fixes that by counting:

> "Did the AI *surface* the brand inside the answer in a meaningful, verifiable way?"

---

### The Intent Model: CPX
CPX (Cost per Exposure) measures verified, human-seen exposures tied to an explicit intent signal inside an agentic environment.  

Each CPX event is:  
- Signed by verifiers (platform + network)  
- Linked to a serve_token  
- Auditable end-to-end  

Advertisers pay only for real, verified interactions — not assumptions.

---

### Why Create a New Metric?
Many advertisers ask: *why change?* CPM has worked for decades and is easy to understand.  
But AI-driven discovery breaks the assumptions that made CPM valid.  

In a conversational context:  
- There are no “pages” or “impressions” to count.  
- What matters is whether an AI system truly *exposed* a verified recommendation to a user with intent.  
- CPX gives advertisers confidence that every dollar tracks to a verified, human exposure — not a background impression.  

So CPX doesn’t replace CPM out of novelty — it replaces it out of necessity.

---

### Corrected Explanation

**Simple Version:**

CPM charges advertisers for every impression — even if the impression had low attention, poor visibility, or no user intent.
The price is prorated (for example, a $3 CPM means $0.003 per impression), but the problem is **what gets counted as an impression**, not the math.

In AI conversations, there are no pages or banners, so CPM does not make sense.
CPX measures **verified exposures inside conversations**, which is a more accurate and intent-aligned unit.

**One-line Version:**

> With CPM, you pay for impressions whether or not the user actually cared — with CPX, you only pay when the AI truly surfaces your brand in a relevant moment.

---

### Key Differences
| Dimension | CPM (Legacy) | CPX (Agentic) |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Unit | 1,000 impressions | 1 verified exposure |
| Verification | Pixel / cookie logs | Signed event packets |
| Context | Page view | AI conversation intent |
| Fraud Resistance | Low | High |
| ROI Tracking | Indirect | Deterministic |
| User Experience | Intrusive | Contextual |
| Value Alignment | Quantity | Quality |

---

### Why CPX Wins
- Eliminates waste and fraud  
- Ensures fairness — every exposure is verified  
- Strengthens trust between brands, agents, and platforms  
- Creates a shared metric for monetizing AI intent  

---

### Transition Path
Most networks can map CPM → CPX using a simple equivalence:

**$10 CPM ≈ $0.01 CPX per verified exposure**  
(1,000 verified CPX events ≈ $10 spend)

This allows advertisers to migrate gradually without changing total budgets.

---

### Summary
CPX is not just a new metric — it’s a correction.  
It aligns cost with verified value, making *intent* the new unit of trade in the agentic advertising economy.

## TL;DR

- **CPM** = handing out 1,000 flyers on the street. You pay for every flyer, even if most end up in the trash.
- **CPX** = paying only when someone walks up to your counter, asks a question, and actually hears your pitch.
