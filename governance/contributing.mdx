# Contributing to the AMXP Specification

Thanks for your interest in helping shape the AMXP protocol! This repository houses the human-readable specification, JSON Schemas, fixtures, and conformance assets that partners rely on. Thoughtful contributions materially improve the health of the ecosystem.

## Getting Started
1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Make your changes in the appropriate location (docs, schemas, examples, or tests).
3. Run any relevant verification steps or linters.
4. Open a pull request describing the context, motivation, and validation.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Keep normative language crisp and reference the impacted protocol layers.
- Update the changelog when you introduce observable differences for integrators.
- Provide JSON fixtures whenever you add or edit schema definitions.
- Include references to related issues or design documents for traceability.

## Communication
Discussion happens through GitHub issues, pull requests, and the AMXP protocol forums. For sensitive disclosures (especially around security) please follow the process documented in `SECURITY.md`.
