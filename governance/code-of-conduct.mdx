# AMXP Specification Code of Conduct

The AMXP specification community is dedicated to providing a welcoming, harassment-free experience for everyone. Contributors, reviewers, and users are expected to act with empathy, respect, and professionalism at all times.

## Our Standards
- Demonstrate empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Provide constructive feedback and gracefully accept it in return.
- Assume positive intent while remaining mindful of impact.
- Prioritize community safety over individual comfort when conflicts arise.

## Enforcement
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate. Reports can be sent to the AMXP protocol maintainers at `spec@admesh.com` for confidential review.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces as well as in one-on-one communications concerning the project.
