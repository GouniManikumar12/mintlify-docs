title: Wallets and Payouts
description: Learn how AIP automates billing, settlements, and payouts across platforms, ad networks, and brand agents.
---
AIP includes a transparent, automated billing system that converts verified events into wallet balances and monthly payouts.  
Each participant — Platform, Ad Network, and Brand Agent — has their own wallet and ledger entries.

---

## 1. TL;DR

> Wallets record verified value. Payouts distribute that value fairly, automatically, and on schedule.

---

## 2. Why it matters

Legacy ad systems rely on delayed invoicing, reconciliation spreadsheets, and manual payouts.  
AIP replaces that with **real-time, cryptographically verifiable ledgers**.  

This ensures:
- No payment disputes  
- Real-time visibility into balances  
- Deterministic reconciliation for all parties  

---

## 3. Participants and Wallets

| Participant | Purpose | Example Entries |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| **AI Platform Wallet** | Receives revenue share for verified CPX/CPC events | Exposure fees, click revenue |
| **Ad Network Wallet** | Holds temporary balances and manages ledger settlements | Pending payouts, operator fees |
| **Brand Agent Wallet** | Tracks advertiser spend and CPA confirmations | Bids placed, conversions billed |

Every transaction in AIP is linked to a **`ledger_entry_id`** and **`serve_token`**, ensuring perfect traceability.

## 4. Payout Flow

  Platform->>AdNetwork: EventPacket (verified CPX/CPC/CPA)
  AdNetwork->>Ledger: Record transaction
  Ledger->>BrandAgent: Debit (spend)
  Ledger->>Platform: Credit (share)
  Ledger->>AdNetwork: Fee + reserve balance
  AdNetwork->>All: Monthly reconciliation & payout
```

The flow runs continuously, with monthly finalization for confirmed balances.

## 5. Example Ledger Entry

```json
{
  "ledger_entry_id": "led_583f12",
  "serve_token": "srv_20381f",
  "event_type": "CPA",
  "platform_credit": 2.00,
  "adnetwork_fee": 0.50,
  "agent_debit": 2.50,
  "status": "settled",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-30T00:00:00Z"
}
```

Each entry maps one verified event to monetary movement across wallets.

---

## 6. Payout Scheduling

| Cycle | Description | Responsible |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **Real-Time** | Balances update instantly on verified events | Ledger API |
| **Daily** | Ledger snapshots for reporting and reconciliation | Ad Network |
| **Monthly** | Payouts triggered for finalized balances | Ad Network + Settlement Service |

Payouts can be processed via:
- Direct bank transfer  
- Stripe Connect  
- Crypto-compatible ledgers (optional extension)

---

## 7. Handling disputes or reversals

AIP minimizes disputes by making all transactions **verifiable and signed**.  
But if discrepancies occur:
1. A dispute is logged with supporting evidence.  
2. Ad Network validates via the event ledger.  
3. If confirmed invalid, funds revert to originating wallets.  

All adjustments are recorded transparently under a new `revision_id`.

---

## 8. Example of Reconciliation Summary

| Participant | Debit | Credit | Net | Status |
|--------------|--------|---------|------|---------|
| Brand Agent | $2,500 | - | ($2,500) | Paid |
| AI Platform | - | $1,750 | $1,750 | Paid |
| Ad Network | - | $750 | $750 | Paid |

---

## 9. Guarantees

- No manual invoicing — all payouts are event-driven.  
- Balances and ledgers are cryptographically signed.  
- Each participant can verify their own ledger independently.  
- Settlement delays or fraud are mathematically impossible under AIP rules.

---

## Summary

> AIP wallets turn verified intent into money — instantly, transparently, and without reconciliation headaches.
