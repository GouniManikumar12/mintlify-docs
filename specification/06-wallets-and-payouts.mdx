Clearinghouses escrow earnings inside protocol wallets. Funds move according to signed ledger records that reference auctions, bids, and conversion events.

- Ledger entries are append-only and hash-chained for tamper evidence.
- Payout schedules must reference UTC timestamps and supported currencies.
- Reconciliation rules describe how disputes are opened, validated, and resolved.
