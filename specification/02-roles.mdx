AMXP introduces four primary actors:
- **Publisher Nodes** expose impressions or opportunities.
- **Agency Bidders** evaluate opportunities and submit bids.
- **Clearinghouses** adjudicate auctions and emit state transitions.
- **Auditors** independently verify ledger records and compliance signals.

Additional supporting roles—such as privacy sandboxes or identity providers—may appear, but they map to these canonical personas for the purposes of conformance.
