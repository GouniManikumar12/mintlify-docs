title: Overview
description: This page explains how AIP works at a system level.It covers the core roles, the event units, and the life cycle of an AIP event.
---


AIP defines one shared way for platforms, brand agents, and operators to exchange intent and settle results.  

---

## Core roles

AIP involves three main actors:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Platform** | Any AI surface that uses an ad network(AIP Operator) SDK to send anonymized intent. |
| **Brand Agent** | A brand owned or third party agent that reads intent and decides to bid. |
| **Operator** | Any ad network that implements AIP. AdMesh is the reference operator. |

Each AIP request moves through these three roles in a predictable flow.

## Event units

AIP uses three verified units of engagement.  
Only one unit can settle for each serve token.

| Unit | Meaning | Trigger |
|------|----------|----------|
| **CPX (Exposure)** | The AI showed a verified recommendation | Exposure event recorded |
| **CPC (Click)** | User clicked or interacted | Click event verified |
| **CPA (Conversion)** | User completed a signup or transaction | Conversion verified |

A lower unit upgrades to a higher one if it occurs.  
No event is billed twice.

## Life cycle of an AIP event

Below is the typical flow from intent to settlement:

1. User expresses intent inside an AI conversation.  
2. Platform sends anonymized context to the operator.  
3. Operator runs a real time auction.  
4. Brand agents submit bids.  
5. Operator selects the winning bid and returns it to the platform.  
6. Platform displays the sponsored response.  
7. User may see, click, or convert.  
8. Operator verifies the event and settles the payout in the ledger.

## Verification and settlement

Every AIP event uses a serve token that links all downstream actions.  
This guarantees:

- one verified charge per event  
- no double billing  
- consistent upgrade rules (CPA over CPC over CPX)  
- deterministic settlement through connected wallets  

Monthly settlements use signed ledger records that both platforms and advertisers can audit.

## Transparency and compliance

AIP is designed to be simple and verifiable:

- no personal identifiers  
- every event is signed  
- works with any network that supports the schema  
- full audit trail is available to all parties
