description: Definitions of all key terms used in the Agentic Intent Protocol (AIP).
---

Plain-language definitions of every major concept used in AIP — written so marketers, engineers, and finance teams can all understand them clearly.

---

## Core Concepts

**AIP (Agentic Intent Protocol)**  
An open standard that defines how AI platforms, ad networks, and brands exchange verified intent, bids, and payouts.  

**Intent**  
The meaning or goal behind a user’s query or conversation. Example: “Best CRM for startups” shows buying intent.  

**Serve Token**  
A unique ID that links an exposure, click, and conversion together. It prevents duplicates and ensures accurate billing.  

**CPX (Cost Per Exposure)**  
Payment when an ad or recommendation is displayed to a user.  

**CPC (Cost Per Click)**  
Payment when a user interacts or clicks on an ad.  

**CPA (Cost Per Action)**  
Payment when a user completes a valuable action, like a purchase or signup.  

**Event**  
Any measurable action in AIP — such as an exposure, click, or conversion — that can trigger billing or verification.

## Roles

**Platform**  
An AI application or interface that shows responses to users and integrates the AdMesh or AIP SDK to display ads.  

**Ad Network**  
The intermediary that runs auctions, verifies events, and manages ledgers and payouts between brands and platforms.  

**Brand Agent**  
A software endpoint representing a brand or advertiser that bids on verified user intent.  

**User**  
The end person interacting with the AI platform. Their intent triggers the entire protocol flow.  

**Verifier**  
Any participant (usually Platform or Ad Network) responsible for validating that an event or transaction actually happened.

## Data & Verification

**ContextRequest**  
A message sent by the Platform to share anonymized user intent with the Ad Network.  

**BidRequest**  
A request from the Ad Network to Brand Agents to gather bids for a given intent.  

**BidResponse**  
A Brand Agent’s response containing bid price, creative text, and destination URL.  

**AuctionResult**  
The outcome of the bidding process — identifies the winning Brand Agent and includes the serve_token for tracking.  

**Event**
A record of a verified user action (`cpx_exposure`, `cpc_click`, or `cpa_conversion`) used for billing and auditing.

**Ledger**  
A secure, immutable record of all verified transactions between participants.  

**Wallet**  
Each participant’s account balance in AIP. Wallets automatically record credits and debits for verified events.  

**Ledger Entry**  
A single transaction record inside the ledger — including event type, timestamp, and settlement status.

## Security & Compliance

**Signature**  
A cryptographic hash proving that a message was sent by the claimed participant and wasn’t tampered with.  

**Nonce**  
A unique, one-time value added to every signed message to prevent replay attacks.  

**Timestamp**  
The precise time an event or message occurred. Used for ordering and fraud prevention.  

**Audit Trail**  
A chronological log of all protocol events and verifications. Helps trace every exposure, click, and conversion.  

**Anonymization**  
Process of removing or obfuscating personal data from user interactions while keeping them verifiable for analytics.  

**Consent Disclosure**  
Visible label or tooltip on AI platforms (like [Ad] or “Why this ad?”) that informs users of sponsored content.  

---

## Governance & Conformance

**Versioning**  
AIP’s process for managing updates using semantic versioning — ensuring backward compatibility across releases.  

**Schema**  
A structured definition (usually JSON) that describes the required format and fields of AIP messages.  

**Conformance**  
The process of testing whether a system fully follows the AIP specification.  

**Certification**  
An official verification from the AdMesh or AIP registry confirming that a participant passed all conformance tests.  

**Test Suite**  
A collection of automated tests that validate protocol behavior for platforms, ad networks, and brand agents.  

**Deprecation**  
When a feature or API version is gradually phased out and replaced by a newer one while maintaining compatibility.  

---

## Financial Terms

**Settlement**  
The process of finalizing payments after verified events are logged and reconciled.  

**Reconciliation**  
Cross-checking event records, ledgers, and balances between participants to ensure accurate payouts.  

**Dispute**  
A challenge or correction request raised if a participant detects a mismatch in event or billing data.  

**Reserve Balance**  
Funds temporarily held by the Ad Network until all related events are verified and settled.  

**Payout Cycle**  
The recurring schedule (usually monthly) when participants receive verified earnings.
