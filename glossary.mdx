description: Protocol terminology reference for the Agentic Intent Protocol (AIP).
---

Definitions of key terms used in AIP schemas, message flows, and protocol invariants.

---

## Core Entities

**Platform**  
An AI application or interface that emits `PlatformRequest` messages to Operators and receives `AuctionResult` responses.

**Operator**  
The intermediary that receives `PlatformRequest` messages, derives `ContextRequest` messages, runs auctions, and returns `AuctionResult` responses.

**Brand Agent**  
A software endpoint representing a brand or advertiser that receives `ContextRequest` messages and submits `BidResponse` messages.

**User**  
The end person interacting with the Platform whose intent triggers the protocol flow.

---

## Protocol Objects

**PlatformRequest**  
A message sent by a Platform to an Operator containing user intent and context. Uses UCP (User Context Protocol) format.

**ContextRequest**  
A message derived by the Operator from a `PlatformRequest` and sent to Brand Agents. Contains anonymized intent signals in a UCP-like format.

**Bid**  
A message submitted by a Brand Agent containing pricing, creative content, and recommendation data.

**BidResponse**  
A Brand Agent's response to a `ContextRequest` containing a `Bid` with pricing and creative information.

**AuctionResult**  
The outcome of an auction returned by the Operator to the Platform, identifying the winning bid and including a `serve_token`.

**Serve Token**  
A unique identifier generated by the Operator that links all events resulting from a single auction outcome. Used to associate exposure, click, and conversion events to the same decision.

**Event**  
A record of a verified user action (`cpx_exposure`, `cpc_click`, or `cpa_conversion`) that is attributable to a `serve_token`.

**EventPacket**  
The protocol structure containing event data, including `event_type`, `serve_token`, and `timestamp`.

## Economic & State Terms

**CPX (Cost Per Exposure)**  
A billing unit representing payment when an ad or recommendation is displayed to a user.

**CPC (Cost Per Click)**  
A billing unit representing payment when a user interacts or clicks on an ad.

**CPA (Cost Per Action)**  
A billing unit representing payment when a user completes a valuable action, such as a purchase or signup.

**Event Ladder**  
The hierarchical relationship between event types: CPA > CPC > CPX. Only the highest verified event in the ladder is billable per `serve_token`.

**Exposure**  
A verified event (`cpx_exposure`) indicating that an ad or recommendation was displayed to a user.

**Click**  
A verified event (`cpc_click`) indicating that a user interacted with or clicked on an ad.

**Conversion**  
A verified event (`cpa_conversion`) indicating that a user completed a valuable action, such as a purchase or signup.

**Terminal Event**  
The highest verified event in the event ladder for a given `serve_token`. Only the terminal event is billable.

**State Transition**  
A change in the state of a `serve_token` from one state (e.g., PENDING, EXPOSED, CLICKED, CONVERTED) to another, following protocol-defined allowed transitions.

**Invariant**  
A protocol-level rule that must always hold true for correct AIP behavior, regardless of implementation.

**Intent**  
The meaning or goal behind a user's query or conversation, captured in `PlatformRequest` and `ContextRequest` messages.

**Message ID**  
A unique identifier for a protocol message, used for idempotency and message tracking.

**Session ID**  
An identifier linking multiple protocol interactions within a user session.

**Nonce**  
A unique, one-time value added to signed messages to prevent replay attacks.

**Timestamp**  
The precise time an event or message occurred, used for ordering and replay prevention.
